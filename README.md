### Create the Crownfunding Database
I used the QuickDBD app to sketch the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and saved it as an image file.
Based on the ERD, I created the database schema and saved it as a Postgres file named 'crownfunding_db_schema.sql'.
I created tables using the database schema, then import the csv files to its corresponding SQL table.
