Create the Category and the Subcategory DataFrames
by: Angela Gosewehr
I took the raw data and transformed the category/subcategory column into two separate columns. I then created two dataframes that showed the unique values for the category column and for the subcategory column and an id number for each value. The files were saved to the resource folder as category.csv and subcategory.csv.
